# ECEN 4013 Project 2 Group 2

## About
This project is for Group 2's ECEN 4013 project 2, all of the code contained will be documented and cited if needed. The goal of this project is to create a circuit that can transmit IMU and GPS data through 3 means of communication (USB, UHF RF, and SD Card). This Github project will be used to store all of the code architecture, the details of the project are still being finalized and will be updated soon!

## Details
The current plan is to have two seperate circuits based on difficulty. The first circuit will be the main focus with the details contained below, the second circuit details have not been finalized yet.

Micro controller: Raspberry Pi Pico  
GPS: Adafruit Mini GPS PA1010D  
Radio: HC05  IMU Adafruit BNO055  
SD Card:  HW-125 SPI Micro SD Board  
Battery: LP103454
